##  Story

My family operates a bakery in Keelung City, so there are many members to manage. In the past, we

used paper cards to identify members, but this caused inconvenience and wasted resources. 

Therefore, I took it upon myself to learn programming and developed this membership system. It 

allows for quick inquiry of member status using their phone numbers.
